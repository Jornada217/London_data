# London_data
Greater London Data Studies and Machine Learning.
This is part of my Mst dissertation, submitted to the University of Cambridge in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Studies of Interdisciplinary Design in the Built Environment.

These notebooks use the merged Land Registry Prices Paid with EPC Certificates and Census datatets. For privacy reasons, I am not uploading the datasets, bu tha algorithms are disclosed.

In the folder GLA-data there is a sequence of 18 algorithms used to parse and merge the EPC, Prices Paid, GLA, Census and Economic data. Use the sequence in file names, not the order set by github to read through the files.
